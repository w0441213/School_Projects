The course is designed to familiarize learners with the process and methodologies used to discover, analyze, cleanse, integrate and provide large and potentially volatile datasets from heterogeneous data sources to complex processing environments. Progression of skill in this course is done in the end-to-end context of the ETL process within an encompassing Data Governance structure. Enterprises that have adopted a modern data architecture including noSQL platforms must reconcile data management realities when they bring existing and new data from disparate platforms under management. Learners will investigate, discover and identify data sources based on analyzed client requirements, link to those data, perform cleansing, perform any necessary transformations, accurately integrate and load the data to its end platform. Due to the fact that in production, data programmers may be applying all or any component of the ETL process, a variety of platforms will be used ranging from command line ANSI standard SQL to comprehensive ETL suites. Every platform choice in the course will reflect current local industry standards.

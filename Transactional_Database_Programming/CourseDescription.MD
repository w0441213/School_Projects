This introduction to SQL and transactional processing is designed to give learners a familiarity and hands-on practice with the basic command line interface to an RDBMS. SQL query and data manipulation commands will be fully developed. Data definition language (DDL) commands including CREATE, ALTER and DROP will be developed and practiced to fine-tune database structure and architecture. The course will move on to cover transactional processing, and learners will be challenged to complete a project that demonstrates their mastery of database SQL concepts.

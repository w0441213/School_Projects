                Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field of the best long-distance runners </br>
                in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course record set last year </br>
                by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished second and third, respectively. Laura's victory came on the heels</br>
                of her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.</br>
            </p>
            <p class = "topNews" id="para2">
                In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's marathon for the second </br>
                straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle Wills of Billings, Montana, finished second </br> 
                when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of Boulder, Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.</br>
            <p class = "topNews" id="para3">
                This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with over 9500 men and </br> 
                6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.</br>

                Highway 7 Reopens
            </h1>

            <p class = "subNews" id="articleA">
                Highway 7 will reopen this Friday, </br>
                June 3rd, after a final safety inspection.</br>
                A late blizzard delayed road crews, </br>
                marking this as one of the latest dates on </br>
                record for the highway's reopening.</br>
                </br>
                Rising to an elevation of over 12,000 feet, </br>
                Highway 7 is a main link between Estes Park </br>
                and Grand Lake. The reopening of the road is one </br>
                 of the annual signs that summer is near and the </br>
                 tourist season will soon be upon us!</br>

                Cougar Sightings Increase 
            </h1>

            <p class = "subNews" id="articleB">
                Cougar sightings have increased 40% in the Este Park </br>
                area according to a report released yesterday by the state DNR.</br>
                In the last month alone, there were ten sightings in Estes Park </br>
                and the surrounding communities of Grand Lake and Pinewood Springs.</br>
                This compares to only twelve sightings for the entire spring of last year.</br>
                </br>
                Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include </br>
                increasing encroachment by people into former wildlife habitats and </br> 
                new wildlife regulations that result in decreasing numbers of elk </br>
                and deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into </br>
                developed areas, following the herds.</br>
                </br>
                DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report </br>
                line at 555-6981 if they believe they have seen a cougar </br>
                or any large predatory animal. Two fatalities have already </br>
                occurred in the west this year from cougar attacks.</br>
            </p>

                If You Encounter a Cougar 
            </h1>

            <p class = "subNews" id="articleC">
                Stop, stand tall, and don't run. A cougar's instinct is to chase.</br>

                Try to appear larger than the cougar by raising your arms.</br>

                Back away slowly, always keeping eye contact.</br>

                If the cougar displays aggressive behavior, shout and wave your arms. </br>
                
                Convince the cougar that you are not prey, but a potential danger.</br>

                In case of an attack, stay on your feet and fight back aggressively. </br>

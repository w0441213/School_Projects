This course provides an introduction to the fundamentals of logic and computer programming, and the roles they play in creating software solutions for any problem. Logic is used to break down software instructions into manageable tasks, to allow for comprehensive problem-solving using computer code. Programming is the act of creating the detailed instructions used by computers to perform any specified task or required behaviour. This course covers the process of creating logical designs and implementing them as programmatic code to build computer software programs.

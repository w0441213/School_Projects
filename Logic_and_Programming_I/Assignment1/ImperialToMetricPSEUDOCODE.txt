IMPERIAL TO METRIC CONVERTER

STEP 1: Identify the variables.

	VARIABLES:
	1) TONS
	2) STONES
	3) POUNDS
	4) OUNCES
	5) TOTAL OUNCES
	6) TOTAL KILOS
	7) METRIC TONS
	8) LEFTOVER GRAMS
	9) LEFTOVER TONS
	10)LEFTOVER KILOS

STEP 2: Display/Print the welcome message and information.

STEP 3: Initialize the variables

STEP 4: Ask the user for the input: tons, stones, pounds, ounces

STEP 5: Cast the variables to be able to use them in the equations

STEP 6: Equations
     
    A6:	Get the total ounces:
		total ounces = (35840*Tons) + (224*Stones) + (16*Pounds) + Ounces
   
    B6: Get the total kilos:
		total kilos = total ounces / 35.274
   
    C6: Get the metric tons and cast to integer:
		metric tons = int(total kilos/1000)
   
    D6: Get the leftover tons to use for calculating the leftover kilos & initialize as a float
		leftover tons = float(total kilos/1000) - metric tons

    E6: Get the leftover kilos to use for the final output
		leftover kilos = leftover tons*1000

    F6: Get the leftover grams.. subtract the float value for kilos by the integer value for kilos to get the leftover grams
		leftover grams = (leftover kilos - int(leftover kilos)

STEP 7: Format the Leftover Grams to 1 decimal place
STEP 8: Display/Print the output: metric weight

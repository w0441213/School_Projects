WEEKLY LOAN CALCULATOR
STEP 1: Identify the variables

		VARIABLES:
		1)loan amount
		2)interest rate
		3)number of years
		4)weekly payment amount

STEP 2: Display/print the welcome and information message

STEP 3: Initialize the variables

STEP 4: Ask the user to put in the input needed for the equation: loan amount, interest rate, and number of years

STEP 5: Cast the variables to integer or float to be able to use it in the equation

	loan amount    = float
	interest rate  = float
	number of years= integer
	weekly payments= float

STEP 6: Equations
	
    A6: Getting the value of "i" for the equation
	I= (interest rate/5200)
    
    B6: Getting the weekly payment amount
	Weekly payment = 1+I
		       = (1+I)**(-52*number of years)
		       = 1 - ((1+I)**(-52*number of years))
		       = I / (1-(1+I)**(-52*number of years))
		       = (I/(1-(1+I)**(-52*number of years))) * loan amount

STEP 7: Format the weekly payment amount to 2 decimal places

STEP 8: Print the output: Formatted Weekly Payment Amount
